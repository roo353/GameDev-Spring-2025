# GameDev-Spring-2025
Repo for spring 2025

LAB01
  For this lab, I made a realistic model of a mealworm beetle. There was no sculpting and it was all done with hard modeling. I constantly worked between a smooth and unsmoothed version to make sure the topology looked nice but it also looked good smoothed. 

LAB02
  For this lab, I used my rig of Tom from Tom and Jerry that has a fully fleshed out RK system with limb stretch and limb twist as well as fully functional feet.
